# Pokemon Red/Blue Randomizer

Consult this repository's main README for general details on this script.


# Version compatibility

Tested for compatibility with the current build (as of Jan 7, 2017) of:
Disassembly of [**Pok√©mon Red/Blue**][pokered]
[pokered]: https://github.com/iimarckus/pokered


# How to use

Ensure that the folder containing the Red disassembly is named "pokered". Then put the pokered folder in the same directory as randomize.py, and run randomize.py. Afterwards, build the Red and/or Blue ROMs as you normally would. Badabing, badaboom.


# Notes/exceptions

- Starter and fossil pokemon families are shuffled, however, the overworld texts etc are not changed to reflect this. Also, your rival's pokemon does not get altered.
- Trade-exclusive families are not randomized, nor are gift-exclusive families. Same for overworld-exlusive pokemon and Game Corner-exclusive pokemon.
